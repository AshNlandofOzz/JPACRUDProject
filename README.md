# JPACRUDProject
As someone who has found myself pouring hard earned dollars into the well being of my fish, I need an effective way to keep a record of the environment they live in. This brought about the creating of "Fish Tank Water Test Tracker".
# Technologies Used
For this project, a user can enter the date and information of their water test and this is kept and maintained in a mySQL database. The data can be manipulated from a webpage.
This was built in Sprint Tool Suite via a Spring framework. Specifically this utilized Spring Boot. There was some BootStrap utilized for the front end and a CSS stylesheet carries the theme for the design.
# Challenges
The biggest challenge on this project was definitely trying to get the moving parts and pieces talking to each other. The other issue I run into with these larger projects is ensuring I am using the same names with no case differences and no typos. I seem to spend half the weekend looking for simple mistakes. Overall a great project and I wish I had more time to explore adding to fun things like informational links to my front end. This is something I can always revisit later. A very good learning experience.
# Classmates
Due to my drill weekend schedule I would never have made it this far without my classmates help. I was unable to utilize any TA time but Josh and Aspen both took time out of their busy weekends to look at my code and help me find my errors when I was tired and frustrated in the evening. They will be wonderful future leaders and teammates in the industry.
